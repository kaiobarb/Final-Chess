# Final-Chess
It's the FINAL CHESSDOWN*

##Game Summary: 
It’s kinda like chess, but not really. It is you versus another player/AI, and you control 16 pieces with different movesets, just like chess… and that’s where the similarity ends. Pieces are characters with movesets, health, and a variety of other rpg elements. Use your semi-strategic abilities to not only outsmart, but outbrawl your opponent. I had thought of this idea before I found out about the Dota2 chess mod in class, but I guess it’s like that game too :V 
The inspirations for this game are chess (obviously) and Tactics Ogre.

##Game Outline: 
Single player (or two player) turn based game. During a single turn, a player chooses a piece to move and attack with. Player chooses direction that piece will face at the end of movement. Attack happens after movement has taken place. Once the attack has been executed, player can choose to move and/or attack with another piece, or end turn. There is no limit for how many piece may be moved in a single turn.
Piece roles and movement are exactly the same as in chess (e.g: pawn moves 1 forward, 2 at start; rook moves in any unoccupied straight, non-diagonal line). Roles share a set of attacks. The number of attacks each role has varies, as does the types of attacks available to them. Attacks can be either melee (reach up to one block adjacent to the piece using attack) or ranged, and are either direction-specific (e.g: directly in front), any direction, or directionless (e.g. an aura or targeted attack).
